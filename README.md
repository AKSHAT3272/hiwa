# HIWA is a Horribly Insecure Web Application

## Features

This horribly insecure web application is designed to illustrate
a number of common web application vulnerabilities. Specifically,
among its features are:

1. SQL injection for authentication bypass
2. XSS 
3. Insecure object references allow access control bypass
4. Insufficient sanitation of input parameters allows privilege escalation
5. Inappropriate use of encryption stored credentials as plaintext passwords
6. Insecure file upload capability leads to arbitrary code execution

## Installation

HIWA is written in PHP, using a Postgresql backend. Some hands-on experience
with getting these programs to work is expected by the reader. At a later
time, I might write up more detailed instructions.
